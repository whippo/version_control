## Considerations for version control

- Works best for text or numerical files (.txt, .csv, .R)
- Requires initial setup and software 
- Can be scary!

## What do you need to use version control?

- A computer (duh)
- Version control software (Git, Subversion)
- An interface (RStudio, GitKraken)

## What does version control look like?

- Create repository ('repo') that will hold files
- Make changes to your document and save
- 'Commit' your changes via Git interface
- 'Push' your changes to the cloud
